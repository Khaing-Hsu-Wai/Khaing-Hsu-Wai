### Hi, I'm PuTuu (a lovely nickname given by my grandparents — it means the world to me 🌏)

I am lazy, so I am moving at my own pace — but that is okay, as long as I am happy.  
Now, I am working at [this (cute) university](https://www.akita-u.ac.jp/eng/).

In my free time, I enjoy:  
- crocheting 🧶
- watching Kdrama 🎞️  
- dreaming up weird project ideas I may or may not build 💡

My current favorite quoåte is:  
**"Without haste, but without rest."**  
**「急がずに、でも休まずに。」**  
— I found it on my professor’s website, and it stayed with me ever since.

Let’s be happy in our own little world 🌷
